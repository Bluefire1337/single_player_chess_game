# single_player_chess_game

I have made a single-player chess game in Python, with all the rules, that includes:
- en passant
- castling
- promotion
- stalemate
- 50 move rule
- three-fold repetition (using Zobrist hashing)

Instead of checkmate however, the winning condition is capturing the king. Once you win as a color, the perspective switches. I want to train a neural network to play the game.

Picture of the board:
